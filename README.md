# Problem
Employee attrition occurs when the size of your workforce diminishes over time due to unavoidable factors such as employee resignation for personal or professional reasons. It is the silent killer that can swiftly disable even the most successful and stable of organizations in a shockingly spare amount of time.Understanding the motivations behind employee attrition is the essential first step in understanding the problem and properly addressing it before substantial, long-lasting damage is caused to any organization.

The data used in this case is the total employee data and it is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. 

# My Role
This is where I come into the picture, I needed to identify the trends by analyzing the data containing the attrited employees.

# The Conclusion and Recommendations.
* Most attrition is from entry level positions. Create long term career or training paths
* Employees with a Bachelorâ€™s degree tend to leave more and this might be due to low monthly income, wanting to advance their career levels by going to school to get masters and   Doctor degrees.
* Employees that worked overtime have a high attrition rate. Employees should not work more than their standard hours.
* Low income is also a factor that leads to employee attrition.
* Most of the attrited employees worked close to home, team activities can be organized, that is, game room or recharge room.
* Employees tend to leave after a period of years without promotion. Improve promotion policy.
