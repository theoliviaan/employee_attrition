# My Role
This is where I come into the picture, I needed to identify the trends by analyzing the data containing the attrited employees.

# The Conclusion and Recommendations.
* Most attrition is from entry level positions. Create long term career or training paths
* Employees with a Bachelor’s degree tend to leave more and this might be due to low monthly income, wanting to advance their career levels by going to school to get masters and   Doctor degrees.
* Employees that worked overtime have a high attrition rate. Employees should not work more than their standard hours.
* Low income is also a factor that leads to employee attrition.
* Most of the attrited employees worked close to home, team activities can be organized, that is, game room or recharge room.
* Employees tend to leave after a period of years without promotion. Improve promotion policy.
